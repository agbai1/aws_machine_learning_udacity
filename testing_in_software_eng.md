### TESTING IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
* Essential before deployment.
* Helps catch error and faulty conclusions before making major impact.
* Can run into execution error in code

#### Testing and Data Science
* Sometimes error will not always be visible.
* Usually when a code breaks, it can be easily detectible and that can subsequently be fixed
* Other times, you might have values encoded incorrectly, features not used appropriately, and these kind of error won't cause a program to crash.
* Catching these kinds of errors requires checking quality and accuracy of analysis in addition to quality of code.
* **TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT:** process of writing test for task before the code to implement those task are written
* **UNIT TEST:** test that covers a unit of code, usually a function, and independent from the test of the program
